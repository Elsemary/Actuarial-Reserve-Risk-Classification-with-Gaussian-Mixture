Abstract :
The loss triangle is effective in calculating the actuarial reserve. In this work, we will try to classify each number in this triangle 
into a specific category useful in estimating the risks associated with this.
We will not focus too much on the loss triangle or use an innovative way to create it, but will focus more on making the model creatively.
The final shape of the loss triangle will be different, as it will be a heat map showing the different ratings for each number,
Also we will use the new data generation from our model as a measure of the expectation of the missing part of the loss triangle.
